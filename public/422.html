    <p>Hmmmm this is a tricky one. To be honest the best thing to do is try whatever you did again (if thats what you meant to do) and see if the gremlins dissapear. If you are here for a second time would you mind sending me a mail (<a href="mailto:help422@fromwhereitsgrown.com">help422@fromwhereitsgrown.com</a>) telling me how this happened. If you know what browser you are using that would be really helpfull too.</p>
    <p>Thanks Tom</p>
