This video shows me changing my order for the fictional Toms Organics supplier, your suppliers products will be different but the principle remains the same

Here are some examples of what you can do:

If I'm going away next week I can cancel my order by setting the quantities to zero

If I want to order extra potatoes for my next order then I drag the potatoes from the product list into the order

If I want to change my regular order I can either drag a new product into it or change the quantity

When I am finished changing my order I need to click the 'Update My Order' button and my supplier will be notified
